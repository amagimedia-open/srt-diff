1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,684
Mr Stark, hi there.

2
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:06,021
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:08,231
Anything else you can tell us?

4
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,318
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

5
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,153
I'm just saying.

6
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,283
Is that what you want?

7
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,162
Here's a little holiday greeting

8
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,664
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

9
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:27,125
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

10
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,879
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:34,007
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

12
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:36,343
that you just died, pal.

13
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,553
I'm gonna come get the body.

14
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:41,389
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

15
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,684
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

16
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:48,605
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

17
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:52,192
10880 Malibu Point.

18
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,444
90265.

19
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,363
I'll leave the door unlocked.

20
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,646
That's what you wanted, right?

21
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,535
Bill me.

22
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:09,960
I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,

23
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:14,255
drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.

24
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,883
Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.

25
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:22,847
Okay. What have we got here?

26
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:27,268
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "adviser to the king."

27
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:30,647
South American insurgency tactics.

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,191
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

29
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:37,612
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theater. Close.

30
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,282
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.

31
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:44,995
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.

32
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,747
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theater?

33
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,832
No, sir.

34
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,876
Talk to me, Happy.

35
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,522
When is a bomb not a bomb?

36
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:24,951
Any military victims?

37
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,601
Not according to public record, sir.

38
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,789
Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.

39
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:31,583
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

40
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,377
The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.

41
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:35,545
Accessing satellites

42
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:39,507
and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.

43
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,635
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

44
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:49,100
Nope.

45
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:57,233
That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?

46
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,778
It predates any known Mandarin attack.

47
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,697
The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.

48
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,616
Bring her around.

49
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,702
The heat signature
is remarkably similar.

50
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,829
3,000 degree Celsius.

51
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,708
That's two military guys.

52
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,741
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

53
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,671
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.
